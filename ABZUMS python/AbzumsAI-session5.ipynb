    "# Medication Dosage Monitor Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what you have learnt so far, these are three exercises with a medication dosage monitoring scenario. Each exercise processes patient data (name, age, weight, and dosage records with time and dose in mg) and applies weight-based and age-based safe dose ranges. The safe dose range is:\n",
    "- **Adults (age ≥ 18)**: 0.1–0.5 mg/kg\n",
    "- **Pediatrics (age < 18)**: 0.05–0.3 mg/kg\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises increase in difficulty, building on each other with validation, alerts, averages, risk assessment, and exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Only Exercise 1 is considered as graded assignment. The other two are the materials for the upcoming session. "
